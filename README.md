# Unity_Datagathering_Demo
A demo for Android devices 7.0 or above (API level 24) that demonstrates the possibility of sending gps data (latitude, longitude and proximity to POI's) to Streamr through the use of a location-based-game made with Unity.
The app will ask the player for their username, streamID and an APIKey. After the first use, these fields will retain their previous values.
The app will then prompt the player for their permission on sharing their data to Streamr.
